# Bernoulli-Naive-Bayes-Spam-Classifier
This repository contains an implementation of a spam classifier using the Bernoulli Naive Bayes algorithm. The classifier is trained on a small dataset of text messages to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages. The implementation includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions on new data.
